<p class="c2"><span>For quite some time I have been thinking to write a blog post on my GSoC journey and the start to open source contributions . Finally with just some days left off the GSoC timeline I decided to take some hours off and put up whatever crossed by mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>We have a three months summer vacation here in IIIT. This was to be my third summer holidays and I wanted to do something that is not directly related to academics and was interesting and meaningful. The options I had were an internship, a college project, practice for competitive programming or Open Source development under the Google summer of code (GSoC). I decided to give it a shot at GSoC.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>It all started about a year and half back when I heard about open source for the first time. Last year just before the GSoC applications began we had an information session which got me excited about contributing but I decided to let go for that year. But, this year I had no plans for the summer. So, thought better than wasting it with doing nothing productive and watching a few TV series, lots of movies, etc, why not spend time on something exciting and meaningful. The best part about GSoC is that you have the potential to reach tons of real users through your code. This is quite different from college projects where you do stuff just for grades and personal learning. The first step towards participating in Google summer of code is deciding on an organisation after going through a long list. At the start I had absolutely no idea how to decide on an organisation. So, I went throught the ones which used technologies I was comfortable with and tried to get in touch with them. Based, on the initial interactions I filtered them out slowly. My initial list had 30 organisation I was interested in which is very large considering you can work with one and applying requires significant efforts. My initial conversation with OERu made me slowly inclined towards it. The main reasons for deciding on OERu was that they were very flexible with the ideas. I was allowed to ideate about what is to be built. Thinking about ideas was the best time of the process for me and my organisation provided me that right through the course of the summer. All organisations in GSoC are supposed to have an ideas page which act as starting points to the project proposal. Most of the work I did during the summer finally turned out to be &nbsp;different from any of the initial ideas.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Now, let me come to the project. The first part about thinking about the project is writing a proposal. In my experience it only acts as the first draft of what you want to do. Even in a three month timeline plans change quite dramatically once you actually start working. Its about the same story of almost everyone who are working on projects under GSoC with different organisations this year, I have interacted with. The initial plans are generally quite ambitious. But, you realise once you are into the project that three months is actually quite a small time. For my project, there were three major things I wanted to do.</span></p><ul class="c5 lst-kix_qkzkcw20z3mm-0 start"><li class="c1"><span>Implement a Peer Evaluation system for WikiEducator</span></li><li class="c1"><span>Explore ways to enhance the course delivery and registration scheme</span></li><li class="c1"><span>Try to adapt the useful features from the wikipedia Education Program Extension</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>The second part turned to be a subfeature of one the modules of Peer Evaluation. We later realised that the Education program of wikipedia did something quite different than what would be useful to wikieducator. There turned out to be a fundamental difference on how courses are organised in the WikiEducator system and the Education Program Extension. The later provided a hierarchical level of institutions, courses and students based on an assumption that a course is delivered by an institution. The WikiEducator model on the other hand allows a course which might be based on a collaboration of several universities. &nbsp;Thus, we decided to use only a concept of structuring courses and student registrations from this scheme and use it for one of the two models of Peer Evaluation. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>The GSoC program is structured into the community bonding period and the coding period. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>The community bonding period was a very eventful time for me. The OERu community gave me an overwhelming welcome into the community and I was quite motivated to make sure that the project is successful. This was the time to ideate and get extensive feedback on the plans for the summer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Next, the coding period kicked off in mid-May. &nbsp;For one or two weeks I had absolutely no idea where to start with. My mentors were very supportive and helpful here. After ideating for a couple of weeks into the coding period I could see time slipping by very fast considering the total time available for coding is only 12 weeks with a lot to do. So, I decided to start building something. The first iteration of the Peer Evaluation prototype was far from perfect and had lots of bugs. The mediawiki extension I had started writing for it consisted of about 4-5 special pages and I hadn&#39;t really thought about the technical structure of how the system should finally look like and how could this be integrated into a part of a course. But, building this first prototype helped me understand mediawiki much better than just reading the documentation. The first major problem I encountered was due to the different versions of mediawiki available. I downloaded the latest version of mediawiki and played with it for about a week and built the first prototype consisting of Special Pages. All the documentation I had read and used until now was for the latest version of mediawiki but I soon realised that the one used by WikiEducator was about 8 versions older. So, when I pushed the code to a beta instance, nothing was working. For, about a couple of days I had no idea how to adapt my code to older versions. In my knowledge. the official documentation of mediawiki is available only for the last 3 releases. So, for some days I had nowhere to look and tried doing things by just looking at mediawiki code. But, that was the least productive way of doing things. After 2-3 days of doing this, my mentor (Jim) pointed out that there may be a revision history available to documentation present in wiki pages. This information turned out to be extremely vital for me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>In the first iteration there was no way of putting it to the flow of a course in the wiki. &nbsp;For this purpose I decided to use tags. This gives the instructor freedom to use them anywhere in the wiki as part of the structure of a course. Around this time came a open mOOC conducted by the OERu. One of my mentors(Wayne) was a facilitator of the course and he was very grateful to let me test a prototype so that I could get some feedback and improvise on it. This, meant that I had to get the system working completely and be used by real users. It acted as a very good motivation for me and also required that the system to me up and deployed during the course timeline which was only about 20 days. So, it helped me have a deadline and push a lot more than otherwise, to get everything in place. I had come up with custom tags to be used for Peer Evaluation in this course. The prototype received 2539 overall pageviews, 63 evaluations and 25 activity submissions. </span></p><p class="c2"><span>The were some very useful insights that we got from the prototype testing. &nbsp;The rubrics that we used for most of the activities were too complicated. We had too many options for the end learner. For a very simple example - we had an optional comment for every evaluation question asked. We saw that almost no one were using these optional comments so we decided to have a single comment as a whole. &nbsp;One of my mentors , Wayne, came up with </span><span class="c3"><a class="c4" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwikieducator.org%2FPeer_Evaluation%23Observations_and_reflections_derived_from_prototype_testing&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEb4V67Ky--6VL0mpPzqje7du4b0A">http://wikieducator.org/Peer_Evaluation#Observations_and_reflections_derived_from_prototype_testing</a></span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c3"><a class="c4" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwikieducator.org%2FPeer_Evaluation%2FRecommended_rubric_refinements&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHr_vxWw2aXUpsZVL7en8xX7URTGA">http://wikieducator.org/Peer_Evaluation/Recommended_rubric_refinements</a></span><span>&nbsp;based on the experience from the OCL4Ed course so that we would have a generalized rubric scheme that fits most circumstances. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>The Peer Evaluation prototype project was far from done yet. After the testing on the prototype I spent about 1 week ideating about what to do next. The next challenge for us was to adapt whatever was done for a single course to a generalized scheme so that any facilitator could use Peer Evaluation in his course. &nbsp;The first task was to come up with a generalized rubric format and have a parser for it. So, we came up with </span><span class="c3"><a class="c4" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwikieducator.org%2FExtension%3APeerEvaluation%2FRubricFormat&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGv8eN38eIbXUaRngma_Q6-nZGkig">http://wikieducator.org/Extension:PeerEvaluation/RubricFormat</a></span><span>&nbsp;and I was able to parse it correctly. After testing these and some more refinements, it was time to move on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Now, we needed to decide on the backbone of the next version of the Peer Evaluation extension. Jim, helped me with the API &nbsp;( http://wikieducator.org/Extension:PeerEvaluation/API ) to be used. &nbsp;We wanted to build a strong backend so that we could later come up with any suitable UI&rsquo;s on front of it. For this iteration we decided to store as much data as possible in the wiki itself. My mentors were quite supportive when I suggested this. Now, this meant that I had to parse the text from the wiki to get meaningful data. But, it has several advantages. Wiki already has a very robust mechanism for maintaining the history of edits. So, we know who added what and when without any added effort. In this version, we got the entire extension reduced to a single database table instead to four in the initial prototype. We only have the evaluations stored in the database and an efficient API to retrieve and push the same. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>As, with the above implementation everything is in the wiki itself, we have no structure in the data with respect to a course. Submissions to an activity are just a table in the wiki. They can be for an activity in a course, feedback on something and also used to Peer Evaluate general content outside a particular course. All data is stored and retrieved with respect to the URL of the page where the activities are stored, which also acts as the identifier for the evaluations. I started calling this an activity centric view.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">During the implementation of above there was time where I slipped away on my progress for about a couple of weeks. I was ideating a lot but was unable to put it into code. There were some brief moments when I was unsure that I would be able to get to the next iteration of Peer Evaluation working under the GSoC timeframe. But, I guess if you don&#39;t have even a single such moment would imply your project is not ambitious enough and are not pushing your limits. Although, I was missing the deadlines I promised my mentors during this time, they should a lot of patience with me and I was able to finally come back strongly and get back on the development of the project.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>We decided to have another type of Peer Evaluation inspired by the Wikipedia Education program which keeps a record of which course the activities are a part of. This, meant we would need four additional database tables for this part alone but we have added advantages of having history of the courses a user is a part of and also tracking a progress in a course and contributions. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>I still consider this a first iteration of the Extension and there is scope for a lot of improvement. Three months is a short time for such an ambitious project where we try to form innovative methods of learning and try to provide easy and inexpensive learning resources to thousands of people. During, the start I thought I would be able to do much more during the course of this summer but still consider it as a very good start. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>I consider myself very lucky to be able to be a part of an awesome journey with Google Summer of Code. I want to continue developing with the OERu and would like to see the Peer Evaluation project reach the next level. Post GSoC I will try to maintain and improve the Peer Evaluation extension and also think of more ways to innovate learning and try to implement some of them. </span></p>
